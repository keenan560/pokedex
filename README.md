# Pok√©dex

A simple react native application built with Expo that displays 151 Pokemon.

## Features
- Search through 151 Pokemon provided by the PokeApi.
- Click on a Pokemon and view their details page.
- Change the name of your selected Pokemon and search for it using its new name.

## Logic
Since the application does not have a lot of features I did not find it necessary to use a state management library like Redux or React's out of the box Contex API. Instead I was able to apply useState and useEffect hooks with React Natvigation's params passing capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- React Native
- Expo
- React Native Navigation
